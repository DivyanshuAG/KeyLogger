# KeyLogger
### For now this keylogger notes the keystrokes and when we end the command to stop the file it notes the time, takes screenshot and notes the timestamp when it was being executed. 
### The disadvantage is that it asks the permission of the user to monitor the keyboard.
#### Currenly working on it to fix it.
